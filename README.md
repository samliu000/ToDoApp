# Project 1 - *ToDoApp*

**Name of your app** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Samuel Liu**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **view a list of todo items**
* [x] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [x] User's **list of items persisted** upon modification and and retrieved properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Added check boxes next to each item so user knows which tasks have been completed. This is good for when the user has completed an item on the todo list but does not want to delete it (now, they can just check it off and delete it later!).
